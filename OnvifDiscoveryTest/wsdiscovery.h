/** @page page_notes Notes

@note HINTS:
 - Run soapcpp2 on wsdiscovery.h to generate the SOAP/XML processing logic.
   Use soapcpp2 -I to specify paths for #import
   To build with STL, 'stlvector.h' is imported from 'import' dir in package.
   Use soapcpp2 -j to generate improved proxy and server classes.
 - Use wsdl2h -c and -s to generate pure C code or C++ code without STL.
 - Use 'typemap.dat' to control namespace bindings and type mappings.
   It is strongly recommended to customize the names of the namespace prefixes
   generated by wsdl2h. To do so, modify the prefix bindings in the Namespaces
   section below and add the modified lines to 'typemap.dat' to rerun wsdl2h.
 - Use Doxygen (www.doxygen.org) on this file to generate documentation.
 - Use wsdl2h -R to generate REST operations.
 - Use wsdl2h -nname to use name as the base namespace prefix instead of 'ns'.
 - Use wsdl2h -Nname for service prefix and produce multiple service bindings
 - Use wsdl2h -d to enable DOM support for xsd:anyType.
 - Use wsdl2h -g to auto-generate readers and writers for root elements.
 - Use wsdl2h -b to auto-generate bi-directional operations (duplex ops).
 - Struct/class members serialized as XML attributes are annotated with a '@'.
 - Struct/class members that have a special role are annotated with a '$'.

/**

@page page_XMLDataBinding XML Data Binding

SOAP/XML services use data bindings contractually bound by WSDL and auto-
generated by wsdl2h and soapcpp2 (see Service Bindings). Plain data bindings
are adopted from XML schemas as part of the WSDL types section or when running
wsdl2h on a set of schemas to produce non-SOAP-based XML data bindings.

The following readers and writers are C/C++ data type (de)serializers auto-
generated by wsdl2h and soapcpp2. Run soapcpp2 on this file to generate the
(de)serialization code, which is stored in soapC.c[pp]. Include "soapH.h" in
your code to import these data type and function declarations. Only use the
soapcpp2-generated files in your project build. Do not include the wsdl2h-
generated .h file in your code.

Data can be read in XML and deserialized from:
  - a file descriptor, using soap->recvfd = fd
  - a socket, using soap->socket = ...
  - a C++ stream, using soap->is = ...
  - a buffer, using the soap->frecv() callback

Data can be serialized in XML and written to:
  - a file descriptor, using soap->sendfd = fd
  - a socket, using soap->socket = ...
  - a C++ stream, using soap->os = ...
  - a buffer, using the soap->fsend() callback

The following options are available for (de)serialization control:
  - soap->encodingStyle = NULL; to remove SOAP 1.1/1.2 encodingStyle
  - soap_mode(soap, SOAP_XML_TREE); XML without id-ref (no cycles!)
  - soap_mode(soap, SOAP_XML_GRAPH); XML with id-ref (including cycles)
  - soap_set_namespaces(soap, struct Namespace *nsmap); to set xmlns bindings


@section default Top-level root elements of schema ""
